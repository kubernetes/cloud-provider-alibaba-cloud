      description: IngressClass represents the class of the Ingress, referenced by
        the Ingress Spec. The `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation
        can be used to indicate that an IngressClass should be considered default.
        When a single IngressClass resource has this annotation set to true, new Ingress
        resources without a class specified will be assigned this default class.

                for the same implementing controller. This should be specified as

                "acme.io/ingress-controller". This field is immutable.
