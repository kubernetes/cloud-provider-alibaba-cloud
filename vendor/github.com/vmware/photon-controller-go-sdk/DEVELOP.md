# WARNING: Photon Controller GO SDK is no longer actively maintained by VMware.

VMware has made the difficult decision to stop driving this project and therefore we will no longer actively respond
to issues or pull requests. If you would like to take over maintaining this project independently from VMware, please
let us know so we can add a link to your forked project here.

# Requirements

## Go 1.5 or later

Follow [the instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go. Once
the installation is complete, run:

    go version

to verify that you have installed the version 1.5 or later. Then, create your
[workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) and set the `GOPATH`
and environment variable to point to your workspace:

    mkdir $HOME/go
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go

Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`:

    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

## Godep

Run:

    go get github.com/tools/godep

and verify that the `godep` command is installed in `$GOPATH/bin`:

# Checking out the source and building

Clone the `photon-controller-go-sdk` repo under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/vmware`:

    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/vmware
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/vmware
    git clone (github.com/vmware or gerrit)/photon-controller-go-sdk

Then, restore dependencies and install the `ginkgo` command:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/vmware/photon-controller-go-sdk
    godep restore
    go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo

and verify that the `ginkgo` command is installed in `$GOPATH/bin`:

    ls $GOPATH/bin/ginkgo

To compile, run:

    go build ./...

# Testing

Run:

    go test ./... -v

to run the tests against a mock server. You can set `TEST_ENDPOINT` environment
variable to run the tests against a real Photon Controller endpoint:

    # Need a longer timeout against a real server
    TEST_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9080 go test ./... -v -timeout 1800s

With `ginkgo`, you can run a subset of the tests:

    TEST_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9080 ginkgo -r -focus Tenant -v
